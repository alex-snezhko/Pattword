# Pattword

Pattword is a program that allows you to remember your website passwords visually.

Rather than having to remember an entire string password, Pattword allows you to remember a visual pattern instead, and then translate that visual pattern into a unique password.
Research supports that humans are much better at remembering visual patterns than they are at remembering long text sequences.

Pattword's interface looks very similar to the pattern password option available on android devices, as this is where we got our inspiration from.

The program can be run by simply cloning the repository and running the python script. Make sure that you do not move the script from its initial path that it was run in, for the security features to work properly.
